NAME
----
rquery - Command-line interface to the libreplit API

SYNOPSIS
--------
*rquery* ['OPTION'?] ['QUERY']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
As a part of the libreplit project, rquery allows interacting with the libreplit
public API in order to make requests to Replit's GraphQL-based API. rquery uses
simple command-line flags and standard output to communicate with its user.

The Replit API requires authentication, which can be provided explicitly through
the appropriate command-line flag, or by being given in the 'REPLIT_TOKEN' or
'CONNECT_SID' environment variables.

OPTIONS
-------
*-v*, *--version*::

*-s*, *--subscribe*::

*-t*, *--token*='TOKEN'::

*-j*, *--variables*='VARS'::
